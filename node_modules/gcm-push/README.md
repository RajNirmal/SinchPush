GCM-PUSH [1.0.1]
=========

GCM-Push is a simple and easy to use NodeJS library that allows you
to send push notifications through the Google Cloud Messaging servers to
android devices.


Installation
--------------
GCM-Push can be installed easily by using npm, execute the following command in
your terminal

````
npm install gcm-push
````

Usage
-----------
First you have to require the module in your code, followed by creating
a new instance of it. Google requires a API key in order to accept calls, therefore
the constructor of the module takes one argument - Google API Key.
```
var GCMPush = require('gcm-push');
var gcm = new GCMPush('my_google_api_key'); 
```

###Sending Notifications
To send a notification to a single android device
````
gcm.notifyDevice('device_id', 'notification title', 'my message', [optional soundUri (string)], [optional callback (function)]);
````

or if you want to send the notification to multiple devices
````
gcm.notifyDevices(['device_id1', 'device_id2'], 'notification_title', 'my_message', [optional soundUri (string)], [optional callback (function)]);
````

The given (optional) callback function gets called once the module has finished with sending the notification to GCM. The parameters that get supplied to the callback are error, response, body.

There is more advanced functionality in GCM, than what these functions use, if you want to send your own raw data calls to the GCM server you can use the following method

```
var data = { } // Filled with your own parameters that get send to GCM

gcm.send(data, [optional callback (function)]);

```
